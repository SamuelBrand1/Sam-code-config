Search for relevant papers on: $ARGUMENTS

**CLARIFYING QUESTIONS: Before proceeding, I may ask clarifying questions about:**
- What time period should I focus on? (e.g., last 2 years, last 5 years, all time)
- Do you want specific paper types? (reviews, methods, case studies, applications)
- Should I prioritise recent work or foundational papers?
- Are there specific authors or research groups you're particularly interested in?
- What's the intended use? (literature review, background research, methodology comparison)

## Process

1. **Launch literature-finder agent** to search for papers on: $ARGUMENTS
   - The agent will search local bibliography files and Paperpile collection
   - Provides structured summaries with exact file locations

2. **If deeper analysis needed, launch paper-analyzer agent in parallel** for top relevant papers
   - Create comprehensive summaries of key papers
   - Extract methodological details and insights

## Output

The literature-finder agent will provide:
- Categorized list of relevant papers
- Brief summaries of each paper's relevance
- Exact file locations for further reading
- Identification of key themes and methodologies

**Note: The literature-finder agent handles the detailed search while I coordinate the results and can launch additional analysis as needed.**
