## Processing Guidelines

- **Extract actionable items**: Focus on decisions, commitments, and follow-up tasks
- **Identify key themes**: Group related discussions into logical sections
- **Remove filler**: Eliminate verbal pauses, repetitions, and tangential remarks
- **Preserve context**: Keep important background information and reasoning
- **Professional tone**: Use clear, concise language suitable for sharing
- **Bullet formatting**: Use bullets (•) for main notes, checkboxes (- [ ]) for actions
- **Attendee identification**: List speakers/participants mentioned in transcript

**Task**: Analyse the provided transcript and immediately output structured meeting minutes following the above format. Do not ask for clarification or additional input - process the transcript directly and produce the minutes.
